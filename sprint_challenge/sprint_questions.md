- **What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?**
  - Code reviews allows for others to see things that the creator simply can't from being too close to the project.
  It allows for new and better ideas to flow if good communication is implemented.  It also forces the person that is writing
  the code to put good documentation and comments so that the person reviewing knows exactly what is going on. I personally am starting to pay attention to docstrings and documentation when I review other code. Spending time trying to guess what the code is trying to do is frustrating.
- **We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?**
  - containers allows you to create different environments.  One can create several containers with different environments from one computer. It provides a clean way to keep track of different environments.  It is also helpful when testing new thing. For example, if you change the environment in a way that you did not mean to, or ultimately decide was not a good idea, you can re-start the container and it will be fresh again.  So testing different things is easier as well.
